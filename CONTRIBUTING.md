I would love to add your additions and/or bugfixes to morestachio. 
To ensure that all changes to the codebase ensures that the quallity of code stays on the same level please follow this rules

- Ensure that your coding style is consistant with the rest of the application
- Keep your changes small and do not reformat a whole document because "its not your style"
- Keep unit tests small. A Unittest should only test one case of your code. For Example, if you write a feature that takes an expression, write a unittest that tests that expression then a test that tests an expression with a formatter then with two and so on
- Document your code. Parts of this Project can be quite confusing for someone else as syntax parsing can be very complex. 
- Document your methods. Every public method should have a short, descriptive xml documentation
- Update the Wiki. If you introduce any changes that affect any part of the documentation, please update the wiki accordingly.
- Its ok to not Aim for 100% Test-Coverage but at least your expected in/output should be covered by unittests
