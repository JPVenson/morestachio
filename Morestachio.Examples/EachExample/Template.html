This is a Collection example.

<!-- this will output each value within data. The #foreach does not scope-->
{{#FOREACH item IN Data}}
{{item}} <!--now you can access each element via the item name or any other you set-->
{{/FOREACH}}

<!-- this will output each value within data. The each scopes its children to the item-->
{{#EACH Data}}
{{this}}
{{/EACH}}

<!-- Alternative you could use an alias and access it with the alias. The scope will still change -->
{{#EACH Data AS item}}
{{item}}
{{/EACH}}
